## From data to wisdom
Ah, I love the DIKW framework. You’re right—it is a great way of defining value in terms of PKM.

I _think_ Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom originated with Russell Ackoff, a seminal author in cybernetics/systems sciences. [Here’s the original essay. 56](http://faculty.ung.edu/kmelton/Documents/DataWisdom.pdf)

I also appreciate how [Liz Sanders and Pieter Jan Stappers expand on the use of DIKW in generative research 36](https://current.ecuad.ca/the-fabric-of-design-wisdom) (e.g., arguably, PKM)—in particular, how to fit ideas and vision into the DIKW framing.

Another pull from the literature: All of this is really in service of sensemaking—which is literally a discipline, one I didn’t know existed until I went to design school. [An instructive article is this one by Jon Kolko 33](http://www.jonkolko.com/writingAbductiveThinking.php).
